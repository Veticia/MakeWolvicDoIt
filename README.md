Wolvic is a great immersive web browser, but it has one flaw: you cannot set it as the default browser. This app/plugin is meant to fix this oversight. Make Wolvic Do It will act as a browser (which you can set as the default), but instead of opening the page by itself, it will, as the name implies, make Wolvic do it.
